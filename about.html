<p>Dear visitor, good to see you!</p>
<p>
    My name is Michael Borisov. I'm a software engineer and an agile practitioner. I create software systems and
    I'm quite a lazy programmer. Because of this fact I always look for patterns and practices to build reliable and
    scalable systems quicker. The most interesting topics for me at the moment are - reactive programming and
    event driven architecture.</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately I have to maintain existing code myself as it's not always possible to convince business
    to rebuild everything from scratch. Nobody wants to experience
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect" target="_blank">the second system syndrome</a>
    on his own skin. Because of this fact I always look for patterns and practices to keep code clean and easy
    for maintenance. That's why I invest time learning and playing with micro service architecture style,
    domain driven design and event store.</p>
<p>
    It would be a perfect world where software has been built by software engineers for software engineers only.
    Unfortunately people who use my software usually have to idea about my way of thinking. They even don't know
    if they will like something until the moment they start using it. Because of this fact I always look for
    patterns and practices to collect feedback from my code as soon as possible. That's why I practice agile principles
    and help building software development ecosystems around continuous delivery.</p>
<p>
    I've learned one lesson that I want to share with you here. Happy people produce more than we could imagine.
    I know for myself that I'm happy at work when I have a clear goal, I'm surrounded with people who care, trust and
    support and I actually can do my job the way I see as the best choice for the moment. And I'm confident and
    can be trusted because I have enough information and I've discussed possible solutions with my colleagues.
    Because of this fact I'm not looking for practices and patterns to manage people. Instead I train myself to be a
    good listener and a coach who could always ask a right question and give support making decisions when asked.
</p>
<p>
    Happy coding,<br/>
    Michael Borisov.
